Notes

Eric's concerns that need to be addressed:
- influence of F(M) distribution
- influence of assumption of planar faults and dimensions


potential reviewers:
Axen
Wernicke
Abers
Ekstrom?
collettini



Todo:
- check fault data/refs more
- get repo shipshape
- refs
- bibtex
- supplementary materials:
    - fault data tables
    - sensitivity testing
    - project notebook
put better axis labels on figures
redo calculations with sevier desert detachment, new DV dip, rates


~100 normal fault segments in Tibet, not counting lanfs.
