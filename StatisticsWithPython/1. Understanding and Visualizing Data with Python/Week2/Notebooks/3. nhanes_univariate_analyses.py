# ## Univariate data analyses - NHANES case study
# 
# Here we will demonstrate how to use Python and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to perform some basic
# analyses with univariate data, using the 2015-2016 wave of the [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm)
# study to illustrate the techniques.

# The following import statements make the libraries that we will need available.  Note that in a Jupyter
# notebook, you should generally use the `%matplotlib inline` directive, which would not be used when
# running a script outside of the Jupyter environment.

# In[1]:

DATA_DIR = "/Users/wel51x/Box/MyBox/Courses/Coursera/UMich/StatisticsWithPython/data/"

import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=FutureWarning)

#get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Next we will load the NHANES data from a file.

# In[2]:

df = pd.read_csv(DATA_DIR + "nhanes_2015_2016.csv")

# ### Frequency tables
# 
# The [value_counts](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.value_counts.html)
# method can be used to determine the number of times that each distinct value of a variable occurs in a data
# set.  In statistical terms, this is the "frequency distribution" of the variable.  Below we show the frequency
# distribution of the [DMDEDUC2](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.htm#DMDEDUC2) variable,
# which is a variable that reflects a person's level of educational attainment.  The `value_counts` method
# produces a table with two columns.  The first column contains all distinct observed values for the variable.
# The second column contains the number of times each of these values occurs.  Note that the table returned
# by `value_counts` is actually a Pandas data frame, so can be further processed using any Pandas methods for
# working with data frames.
# 
# The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 seen below are integer codes for the 6 possible non-missing values of the
# DMDEDUC2 variable.  The meaning of these codes is given in the NHANES codebook located
# [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.htm#DMDEDUC2), and will be discussed further
# below.  This table shows, for example, that 1621 people in the data file have DMDEDUC=4, which indicates
# that the person has completed some college, but has not graduated with a four-year degree.

# In[3]:

print("1	Less than 9th grade	688	688")
print("2	9-11th grade (Includes 12th grade with no diploma)	676	1364")
print("3	High school graduate/GED or equivalent	1236	2600")
print("4	Some college or AA degree	1692	4292")
print("5	College graduate or above	1422	5714")
print("9	Unknown")
print(df.DMDEDUC2.value_counts(), '\n')

# Note that the `value_counts` method excludes missing values.  We confirm this below by adding up the
# number of observations with a DMDEDUC2 value equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 9 (there are 5474 such rows),
# and comparing this to the total number of rows in the data set, which is 5735. This tells us that there
# are 5735 - 5474 = 261 missing values for this variable (other variables may have different numbers of
# missing values).

# In[4]:

print("Sum of value counts", df.DMDEDUC2.value_counts().sum())
#print(1621 + 1366 + 1186 + 655 + 643 + 3) # Manually sum the frequencies
print("Shape of DataFrame", df.shape)

# Another way to obtain this result is to locate all the null (missing) values in the data set using the
# [isnull](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.isnull.html) Pandas function,
# and count the number of such locations.

# In[5]:

print("Number of null values DataFrame", pd.isnull(df.DMDEDUC2).sum(), '\n')

# In some cases it is useful to
# [replace](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.replace.html) integer
# codes with a text label that reflects the code's meaning.  Below we create a new variable called
# 'DMDEDUC2x' that is recoded with text labels, then we generate its frequency distribution.

# In[6]:

df["DMDEDUC2x"] = df.DMDEDUC2.replace({1: "<9", 2: "9-11", 3: "HS/GED",
                                       4: "Some college/AA", 5: "College",
                                       7: "Refused", 9: "Unknown"})
print(df.DMDEDUC2x.value_counts(),'\n')

# We will also want to have a relabeled version of the gender variable, so we will construct that now
# as well.  We will follow a convention here of appending an 'x' to the end of a categorical variable's
# name when it has been recoded from numeric to string (text) values.

# In[7]:

df["RIAGENDRx"] = df.RIAGENDR.replace({1: "Male", 2: "Female"})

# For many purposes it is more relevant to consider the proportion of the sample with each of the
# possible category values, rather than the number of people in each category.  We can do this as
# follows:

# In[8]:

x = df.DMDEDUC2x.value_counts()  # x is just a name to hold this value temporarily
x / x.sum()

# In some cases we will want to treat the missing response category as another category of observed
# response, rather than ignoring it when creating summaries.  Below we create a new category called
# "Missing", and assign all missing values to it using
# [fillna](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#filling-missing-values-fillna).
# Then we recalculate the frequency distribution.  We see that 4.6% of the responses are missing.

# In[9]:

df["DMDEDUC2x"] = df.DMDEDUC2x.fillna("Missing")
x = df.DMDEDUC2x.value_counts()
print((x / x.sum())*100)

# ### Numerical summaries
# 
# A quick way to get a set of numerical summaries for a quantitative variable is with the
# [describe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/basics.html#summarizing-data-describe) data frame
# method.  Below we demonstrate how to do this using the body weight variable
# ([BMXWT](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BMX_I.htm#BMXWT)).  As with many surveys, some data
# values are missing, so we explicitly drop the missing cases using the
# [dropna](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html#dropping-axis-labels-with-missing-data-dropna)
# method before generating the summaries.

# In[10]:

print("\nBody weight (Kg) breakdown:")
print(df.BMXWT.dropna().describe(), '\n')

# It's also possible to calculate individual summary statistics from one column of a data set.  This can
# be done using Pandas methods, or with numpy functions:

# In[11]:

x = df.BMXWT.dropna()  # Extract all non-missing values of BMXWT into a variable called 'x'
print("pandas mean =", x.mean()) # Pandas method
print("Numpy mean =", np.mean(x)) # Numpy function

print("pandas median =", x.median())
print("Numpy 50% =", np.percentile(x, 50))   # 50th percentile, same as the median
print("Numpy 75% =", np.percentile(x, 75))   # 75th percentile
print("pandas 75% =", x.quantile(0.75), '\n') # Pandas method for quantiles, equivalent to 75th percentile

# Next we look at frequencies for a systolic blood pressure measurement
# ([BPXSY1](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BPX_I.htm#BPXSY1)).  "BPX" here is the NHANES
# prefix for blood pressure measurements, "SY" stands for "systolic" blood pressure (blood pressure
# at the peak of a heartbeat cycle), and "1" indicates that this is the first of three systolic blood
# presure measurements taken on a subject.
# 
# A person is generally considered to have pre-hypertension when their systolic blood pressure is
# between 120 and 139, or their diastolic blood pressure is between 80 and 89.  Considering only
# the systolic condition, we can calculate the proprotion of the NHANES sample who would be considered
# to have pre-hypertension.

# In[12]:

print("Proprotion with Systolic mean >= 120 & <= 139:", np.mean((df.BPXSY1 >= 120) & (df.BPXSY2 <= 139)))  # "&" means "and"

# Next we calculate the propotion of NHANES subjects who are pre-hypertensive based on diastolic blood pressure.

# In[13]:

print("Proprotion with Diastolic mean >= 80 & <= 89:", np.mean((df.BPXDI1 >= 80) & (df.BPXDI2 <= 89)))

# Finally we calculate the proportion of NHANES subjects who are pre-hypertensive based on either systolic
# or diastolic blood pressure.  Since some people are pre-hypertensive under both criteria, the proportion
# below is less than the sum of the two proportions calculated above.
# 
# Since the combined systolic and diastolic condition for pre-hypertension is somewhat complex, below we
# construct temporary variables 'a' and 'b' that hold the systolic and diastolic pre-hypertensive status
# separately, then combine them with a "logical or" to obtain the final status for each subject.

# In[14]:

a = (df.BPXSY1 >= 120) & (df.BPXSY2 <= 139)
b = (df.BPXDI1 >= 80) & (df.BPXDI2 <= 89)
print("Proprotion with either or both:", np.mean(a | b))  # "|" means "or"

# Blood pressure measurements are affected by a phenomenon called "white coat anxiety", in which a
# subject's bood pressure may be slightly elevated if they are nervous when interacting with health care
# providers.  Typically this effect subsides if the blood pressure is measured several times in sequence.
# In NHANES, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are meausred three times for each subject (e.g.
# [BPXSY2](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BPX_I.htm#BPXSY2) is the second measurement of
# systolic blood pressure).  We can calculate the extent to which white coat anxiety is present in the
# NHANES data by looking a the mean difference between the first two systolic or diastolic blood pressure
# measurements.

# In[15]:

print("Mean difference between the first two systolic measurements:", np.mean(df.BPXSY1 - df.BPXSY2))
print("Mean difference between the first two diastolic measurements:", np.mean(df.BPXDI1 - df.BPXDI2), '\n')

# ### Graphical summaries
# 
# Quantitative variables can be effectively summarized graphically.  Below we see the distribution of body
# weight (in Kg), shown as a histogram.  It is evidently right-skewed.

# In[16]:

sns.distplot(df.BMXWT.dropna()).set_title('Body Weight (Kg) Distribution Plot')
plt.show()

# Next we look at the histogram of systolic blood pressure measurements.  You can see that there is a
# tendency for the measurements to be rounded to the nearest 5 or 10 units.

# In[17]:

sns.distplot(df.BPXSY1.dropna()).set_title('Systolic Blood Pressure Distribution Plot')
plt.show()

# To compare several distributions, we can use side-by-side boxplots.  Below we compare the
# distributions of the first and second systolic blood pressure measurements (BPXSY1, BPXSY2),
# and the first and second diastolic blood pressure measurements ([BPXDI1]
# (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/BPX_I.htm#BPXDI1), BPXDI2). As expected, diastolic
# measurements are substantially lower than systolic measurements.  Above we saw that the second
# blood pressure reading on a subject tended on average to be slightly lower than the first
# measurement.  This difference was less than 1 mm/Hg, so is not visible in the "marginal"
# distributions shown below.

# In[18]:

bp = sns.boxplot(data=df.loc[:, ["BPXSY1", "BPXSY2", "BPXDI1", "BPXDI2"]])
bp.set_ylabel("Blood pressure in mm/Hg")
bp.set_title('1st & 2nd Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure Box Plots')
plt.show()

# ### Stratification
# 
# One of the most effective ways to get more information out of a dataset is to divide it into smaller,
# more uniform subsets, and analyze each of these "strata" on its own.  We can then formally or informally
# compare the findings in the different strata.  When working with human subjects, it is very common to
# stratify on demographic factors such as age, sex, and race.
# 
# To illustrate this technique, consider blood pressure, which is a value that tends to increase with age.
# To see this trend in the NHANES data, we can [partition]
# (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.cut.html) the data into age strata, and
# construct side-by-side boxplots of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) distribution within each stratum.
# Since age is a quantitative variable, we need to create a series of "bins" of similar SBP values in order
# to stratify the data.  Each box in the figure below is a summary of univariate data within a specific
# population stratum (here defined by age).

# In[19]:

df["agegrp"] = pd.cut(df.RIDAGEYR, [18, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]) # Create age strata based on these cut points
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))  # Make the figure wider than default (12cm wide by 5cm tall)
sns.boxplot(x="agegrp", y="BPXSY1", data=df).set_title('Box Plot of Systolic Stratified by Age Group')
plt.show()

# Taking this a step further, it is also the case that blood pressure tends to differ between women and
# men.  While we could simply make two side-by-side boxplots to illustrate this contrast, it would be a bit
# odd to ignore age after already having established that it is strongly associated with blood pressure.
# Therefore, we will doubly stratify the data by gender and age.
# 
# We see from the figure below that within each gender, older people tend to have higher blood pressure
# than younger people.  However within an age band, the relationship between gender and systolic blood
# pressure is somewhat complex -- in younger people, men have substantially higher blood pressures than
# women of the same age.  However for people older than 50, this relationship becomes much weaker, and
# among people older than 70 it appears to reverse. It is also notable that the variation of these
# distributions, reflected in the height of each box in the boxplot, increases with age.

# In[20]:

df["agegrp"] = pd.cut(df.RIDAGEYR, [18, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80])
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
sns.boxplot(x="agegrp", y="BPXSY1", hue="RIAGENDRx", data=df)\
            .set_title('Box Plots of Systolic Stratified by Age Group and Gender')
plt.show()

# When stratifying on two factors (here age and gender), we can group the boxes first by age, and
# within age bands by gender, as above, or we can do the opposite -- group first by gender, and then
# within gender group by age bands.  Each approach highlights a different aspect of the data.

# In[21]:

df["agegrp"] = pd.cut(df.RIDAGEYR, [18, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80])
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
sns.boxplot(x="RIAGENDRx", y="BPXSY1", hue="agegrp", data=df)\
            .set_title('Box Plots of Systolic Stratified by Gender and Age Group')
plt.show()

# do a second 'cause of PyCharm problem.
df["agegrp"] = pd.cut(df.RIDAGEYR, [18, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80])
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
sns.boxplot(x="RIAGENDRx", y="BPXSY1", hue="agegrp", data=df)\
            .set_title('Box Plots of Systolic Stratified by Gender and Age Group')
plt.show()

# Stratification can also be useful when working with categorical variables.  Below we look at the
# frequency distribution of educational attainment ("DMDEDUC2") within 10-year age bands.  While "some
# college" is the most common response in all age bands, up to around age 60 the second most common
# response is "college" (i.e. the person graduated from college with a four-year degree). However for
# people over 50, there are as many or more people with only high school or general equivalency diplomas
# (HS/GED) than there are college graduates.
# 
# **Note on causality and confounding:** An important role of statistics is to aid researchers in
# identifying causes underlying observed differences.  Here we have seen differences in both blood
# pressure and educational attainment based on age.  It is plausible that aging directly causes blood
# pressure to increase.  But in the case of educational attainment, this is actually a "birth cohort
# effect".  NHANES is a cross sectional survey (all data for one wave were collected at a single point
# in time). People who were, say, 65 in 2015 (when these data were collected), were college-aged around
# 1970, while people who were in their 20's in 2015 were college-aged in around 2010 or later.  Over the
# last few decades, it has become much more common for people to at least begin a college degree than
# it was in the past.  Therefore, younger people as a group have higher educational attainment than
# older people as a group.  As these young people grow older, the cross sectional relationship between
# age and educational attainment will change.

# In[22]:

df.groupby("agegrp")["DMDEDUC2x"].value_counts()

# We can also stratify jointly by age and gender to explore how educational attainment varies by both
# of these factors simultaneously.  In doing this, it is easier to interpret the results if we [pivot]
# (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reshaping.html#reshaping-by-stacking-and-unstacking)
# the education levels into the columns, and normalize the counts so that they sum to 1.  After doing
# this, the results can be interpreted as proportions or probabilities.  One notable observation from
# this table is that for people up to age around 60, women are more likely to have graduated from college
# than men, but for people over aged 60, this relationship reverses.

# In[23]:

dx = df.loc[~df.DMDEDUC2x.isin(["Don't know", "Missing"]), :]  # Eliminate rare/missing values
dx = dx.groupby(["agegrp", "RIAGENDRx"])["DMDEDUC2x"]
dx = dx.value_counts()
dx = dx.unstack()                               # Restructure the results from 'long' to 'wide'
dx = dx.apply(lambda x: x/x.sum(), axis=1)      # Normalize within each stratum to get proportions
print("Proportion by Age Group, Education by Gender")
print(dx.to_string(float_format="%.3f"))        # Limit display to 3 decimal places
